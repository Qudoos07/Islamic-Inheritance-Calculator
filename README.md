# ⚖️ Islamic Inheritance (Faraid) Calculator

> **Algorithmic Justice: Automating Sharia Inheritance Distribution**

## 🌟 Project Overview
The **Faraid Calculator** is a web-based tool that automatically calculates inheritance shares according to Islamic Law. It solves the complex mathematical problem of distributing an estate among surviving family members using **Quranic fixed shares** (Ashab al-Furud) and **residuary principles** (Asabah).

This project demonstrates
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Translating 1,400-year-old legal principles into modern code.
- **Mathematical Logic:** Handling fractional distributions (1/2, 1/4, 1/8) and ratios (2:1 for sons vs daughters).
- **Problem Solving:** Automating decisions that traditionally require scholars.

## 🛠️ How It Works
The calculator follows these rules:
1.  **Spouse Share (Fixed):**
    - Husband: 1/2 (no children) or 1/4 (with children)
    - Wife: 1/4 (no children) or 1/8 (with children)
2.  **Children Share (Residuary):**
    - Sons and Daughters split the remainder using a **2:1 ratio**.
    - Example: If 2 sons and 1 daughter remain, total units = (2×2 + 1) = 5 units.
        - Each son gets 2/5 of the remainder.
        - Daughter gets 1/5 of the remainder.

## 📸 Example Calculation
**Input:**
- Estate: 100,000
- Wife: Yes
- Sons: 1
- Daughters: 1

**Output:**
- Wife (1/8): 12,500
- Son (2 parts): 58,333
- Daughter (1 part): 29,167
- **Total:** 100,000 ✅

## 💻 Technical Implementation
- **HTML5:** Clean, responsive form design.
- **CSS3:** Modern UI with visual hierarchy.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Pure logic without frameworks to demonstrate core programming skills.
- **Algorithm Complexity:** O(1) time complexity (instant calculation regardless of input size).

## 📂 Installation
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3.  No installation or dependencies required.

## 🤝 Purpose & Motivation
I built this tool to bridge **Faith and Technology**. Many Muslims struggle with inheritance calculations, which can lead to disputes or reliance on expensive consultants. This free tool empowers families to understand their rights algorithmically. It also showcases my ability to apply Computer Science to solve real-world ethical challenges.
